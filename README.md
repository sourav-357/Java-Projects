# Java Projects Repository 🚀

Welcome to my Java Projects Repository!  
This repository contains complete Java projects developed during my learning journey to apply core programming concepts to real-world problems.

These projects are built using knowledge gained from the **"Java Programming Masterclass" by Tim Buchalka (Udemy)** and additional self-practice.
